## Abstract

This Chrome browser extension attempts to thwart clickjacking attempts by setting the opacity of any iframe to 1.

## Background

<!-- click jacking explanation -->

## Tech Stack

This project uses vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML.

## Setup/Installation

You can clone the repo locally using `git clone git@github.com:garnetred/let-there-be-light.git`.

Without using a terminal you can also visit the project homepage, select the green button that says "code" and then click the option to "Download zip." From there you'll need to unzip the folder before following the rest of the instructions.

### Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers)

[This article](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) offers detailed instructions on loading an unpacked chrome extension. You can navigate to the chrome extensions page via the detective icon in the toolbar. Enable "developer mode" on the top-right. From there, you can click "load unpacked extension" and choose the folder via the popup. You should then see the detective icon appear in the toolbar. When you click on it, you can see a popup that reads "Ghost Glassdoor."

When you navigate to Glassdoor, you should be able to browse the site like normal without having to log in or register.

## Future Changes
Eventually I plan to port the extension to firefox.
